# OCyRS: Orthologues cyanobacterial gene-associated RNA structure motifs

This repository contains the scripts that generate 
an interactive website that is available at https://rth.dk/resources/crs/cyanobacteria/

The website shows the results that were generated by the pipeline https://github.com/asgeissler/OCyRS-pipeline

For details, please refer to the publication:

"Exploring the RNA structure regulatory potential in 202 cyanobacterial genomes"   
AS Geissler, EC Alvarez, C Anthon, NU Frigaard, J Gorodkin, and SE Seemann   
in preparation
